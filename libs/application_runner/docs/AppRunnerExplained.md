# How does ApplicationRunner works ?


## General tree organisation
### The Environment Tree
The Blue part is the environment tree. It exists only once per environment.
An environment is a specific instance of an app with its own data.
Multiple environments can be created for one app. They behave like two app with two databases.

At session start, we ensure that the environment is started. If the environment is already started, we use it. If not, we start the environment tree by first starting the Environment.Supervisor.

The Supervisor starts all the necessary GenServers:

- Environment.MetadataAgent: This is an agent that works mostly like a GenServer. The agent is here to keep all the metadata and make it accessible from every GenServer in the tree.
- Environment.ManifestHandler: This GenServer gets and caches the manifest of the application. In the manifest, we will find routes, root_view, and other information.
- ApplicationRunner.EventHandler: This GenServer is a queue for all events to send to the application.
- Environment.MongoInstance: This GenServer is used to configure the Mongo connection and make calls to Mongo.
- Environment.Events.*: All the tasks under Events are listeners that run on specific Environment lifetime events.
- Environment.ChangeStream: This GenServer listens for Mongo change events.
- Environment.QueryDynSup: This DynSupervisor starts and handles QueryServer that cache data for a specific query. The query server reacts to ChangeStream to reload data.
- Environment.ViewdynSup: This DynSupervisor starts and handles ViewServer that caches views. They react to QueryServer when the data changes to reload the cache.
- Environment.SessionDynSup: This DynSupervisor starts and handles sessions.

The environment is stopped when all of these sessions are stopped. Each session notifies the Environment Supervisor on stop, and if this is the last session handled, the environment stops.

At stop, we send a request to OpenFaaS to scale to zero all application instances.
### The Session Tree
The red part is the Session Tree. It exists once per user session and lives in an environment
One user can open multiple sessions. 
A session is defined by a unique ID (UUID).

A session can be stopped after a long inactivity time.
If it's the case, the client will open a new session (new socket connexion)

TODO : Explain the full red tree

### The Route tree
The yellow part is the Route Tree. It exists once per route and lives in a session.
A route is basically a UI/JSON that lives under a URI.
For example, the route **/users/42** could display a specific user information (for the Lenra UI) or return a specific JSON (for the JSON routes)

## Start the app
### Socket initialization (simplified)

When the socket is initialized (when the user join the app), we also start the Session (Red tree) and the Environment (Blue tree) if it is not started.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Client
    participant AppSocket
    participant Environment
    participant Session
    User->>+Client: Open app
    Client->>+AppSocket: Open the socket
    Note over AppSocket: Check permission
    opt Environment not started
        AppSocket->>+Environment: Start the Environment and deps (blue tree)
        Note over Environment: OnEnvStart is triggered now
    end
    AppSocket->>+Session: Start the Session and deps (Red tree)
    Note over Environment: OnUserFirstJoin is triggered now only the first time the user enter the app
    Note over Environment: OnSessionStart is triggered now
    AppSocket-->>Client: Ok, accepted
    deactivate AppSocket
    deactivate Session
    deactivate Environment
    deactivate Client
```

### New Route Channel (simplified)

When the client open a new route, we start the corresponding RouteSupervisor (Yellow tree)
It directly trigger a UI push in this route channel.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Client
    participant RouteChannel
    participant RouteSupervisor
    participant RouteServer
    participant ViewServer
    participant QueryServer
    participant App
    participant Mongo
    activate Client
    activate Mongo
    activate App
    Client->>+RouteChannel: join route
    RouteChannel->>+RouteSupervisor: Start the Route supervisor (Yellow tree)
    RouteSupervisor->>+RouteServer: Start Route
    alt Lenra Route
        Note over RouteServer: RouteServer use LenraBuilder
        loop recursively
            RouteServer->>+ViewServer: start(query, name, props)
            ViewServer->>+QueryServer: start(query)
            QueryServer->>Mongo: getData(query)
            Mongo-->>QueryServer: Data
            ViewServer->>QueryServer: getData
            QueryServer-->>ViewServer: data
            RouteServer->>ViewServer: getWidget
            ViewServer-->>RouteServer: view
        end
    else Json Route
        Note over RouteServer: RouteServer use JsonBuilder
        RouteServer->>+ViewServer: start(query, name, props)
        ViewServer->>+QueryServer: start(query)
        QueryServer->>Mongo: getData(query)
        Mongo-->>QueryServer: Data
        ViewServer->>QueryServer: getData
        QueryServer-->>ViewServer: data
        RouteServer->>ViewServer: getWidget
        ViewServer-->>RouteServer: view
    end
    RouteChannel-->>Client: Ok
    RouteServer-->>Client: UI
    Client-->>User: Print UI

    deactivate Client
    deactivate Mongo
    deactivate App
    deactivate RouteChannel
    deactivate RouteSupervisor
    deactivate RouteServer
    deactivate ViewServer
    deactivate QueryServer
```

## App lifecycle

### When a listener is called (simplified)

When the user interact with the UI, listeners can be sent to the Server.
When a listener is sent, the server will call the App listener to let the app interact with the data.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Client
    participant RouteChannel
    participant Session.EventHandler
    participant App
    participant DataApi
    participant Mongo
    activate Client
    activate RouteChannel
    activate Session.EventHandler
    activate App
    activate DataApi
    activate Mongo

    User->>Client: Trigger Listener (press button)
    Client->>RouteChannel: send listener with code
    RouteChannel->>Session.EventHandler: send_client_event(code)
    Session.EventHandler-->>Session.EventHandler: Translate code to action/props
    Session.EventHandler->>App: Http call listener (actio, props)
    opt if listener call data api
        loop Any number of call
            App->>DataApi: HttpCall for any CRUD operation
            DataApi->>Mongo: any CRUD operation on data
            Mongo-->>DataApi: OK
            DataApi-->>App: OK
        end
    end
    App-->>Session.EventHandler: OK
    Session.EventHandler-->>RouteChannel: OK
    RouteChannel-->>Client: OK

    deactivate Client
    deactivate RouteChannel
    deactivate Session.EventHandler
    deactivate App
    deactivate DataApi
    deactivate Mongo
```

### When a data change in mongo (simplified)

Generally during a listener call, the mongo data will change.
When this happen, the UI automatically updates.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Client
    participant RouteChannel
    participant RouteServer
    participant App
    participant ViewServers
    participant QueryServers
    participant ChangeEventManagers
    participant ChangeStream
    participant Mongo

    activate Client
    activate Mongo
    activate ChangeStream
    activate ChangeEventManagers
    activate QueryServers
    activate ViewServers
    activate RouteServer
    activate RouteChannel
    activate App

    Note over Mongo: A data changed in mongo
    Mongo->>ChangeStream: new change event
    ChangeStream->>ChangeEventManagers: Broadcast the event to all managers
    ChangeEventManagers->>QueryServers: Broadcast the event to all QueryServers
    opt Event match the query and not already handled
        QueryServers-->>QueryServers: Update the data
        QueryServers->>ViewServers: data_changed(data)
        ViewServers->>App: get view
        App-->>ViewServers: view
    end
    QueryServers-->>ChangeEventManagers: OK
    Note over ChangeEventManagers: when all QueryServers are OK
    ChangeEventManagers->>RouteServer: update
    loop Recursively
        RouteServer->>ViewServers: get view
        ViewServers-->>RouteServer: view
    end
    RouteServer-->>RouteServer: Diff old/new ui
    RouteServer-->>RouteChannel: Patch UI
    RouteChannel-->>Client: PatchUi
    Client-->>User: New UI

    deactivate Client
    deactivate Mongo
    deactivate ChangeStream
    deactivate ChangeEventManagers
    deactivate QueryServers
    deactivate ViewServers
    deactivate RouteServer
    deactivate RouteChannel
    deactivate App
```
